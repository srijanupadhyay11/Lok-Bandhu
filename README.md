# Lok-Bandhu
Lok Bandhu is a crowdsourced civic issue reporting and resolution platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and local authorities. The platform enables users to report civic problems—such as potholes, garbage collection, streetlight failures, or water leakage—using location-tagged submissions, images, and descriptions.
